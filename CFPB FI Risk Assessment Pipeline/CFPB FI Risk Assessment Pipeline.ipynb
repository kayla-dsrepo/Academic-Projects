I called immediately and the initial rep stated they know and can see that I did not physically use my card. So if I did not physically, use my card and you can check the records how was my card use when I was asleep in my bed that does not make any sense and you guys Bank of America denied my dispute and tell me theyre going to purposely overdraw my account for the credit that they provided me for {$970.00}.
