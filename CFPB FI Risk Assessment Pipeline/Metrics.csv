2025-04-30,Checking or savings account,Checking account,Closing an account,Funds not received from closed account,"On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited a {$25000.00} verified Chase cashier 's check from a tenant covering 6 months of rent into my Chase Business Checking account. On XX/XX/XXXX I deposited the second {$25000.00} verified Chase cashier 's check into the same checking account for the remaining 6 months of rent from my tenant. Both checks cleared fine as they were credited to the total balance of the account. 

However, on XX/XX/XXXX, it appeared as if my Chase Business account was restricted & later frozen. No local Chase branch manager could provide an answer for days. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I received a private call from someone at Chase going by the name of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX questioning the source of the funds being paid towards my business. I gave the source information from the tenant 's information, our leasing agreement and all of our documented communication prior to the call. She assured me that it was 2 valid {$25000.00} checks issued by Chase from a Chase branch. She also assured me that my account was restricted at no fault to me or my actions, but an internal investigation into the source of the funds from a fellow Chase customer ( my tenant ) ; which was the reason for the call. 

I also later communicated with her via email on the same day "" As discussed, I would like for my business account to not be restricted as soon as possible so that I can resume paying my commercial landlord via ACH, as well as my employees and contractors at my XXXX  XXXX  in via XXXX XXXX as usual. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I inquired with the Chase representative "" XXXX XXXX XXXX through a JPMorgan Chase secured message platform called "" virtru.com '' stating the following : "" Hello XXXX, Has there been an updated time for the account to be restored? '' Her response : On XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX wrote : "" Hello, I am still waiting on a response. '' On XX/XX/XXXX, my Chase Business Checking account was closed. 
Yet my total balance of {$86000.00} was still unavailable to me completely. 

I submitted her another response : "" Hello XXXX, I received a notification that my Chase Business Debit card was removed from my XXXX XXXX. Then when attempting to log on to my account it stated that it was locked. 
Im presuming that this is all related to this situation. Do you have any insight as to what is going on at this point with my account? 

Thank you '' I never heard a respond from XXXX '' XXXX '' at all. 

At the end of my XX/XX/XXXX checking statement it stated the following : XX/XX/XXXX Debit DDA  - Check Charge - {$50000.00} XX/XX/XXXX Debit DDA - Check Charge - {$36000.00} On XX/XX/XXXX, I was issued a single {$36000.00} cashiers check from JP Morgan Chase. My Chase Business checking account was closed. Although there was another {$50000.00} Check Charge on XX/XX/XXXX as noted by my checking statement, the remaining {$50000.00} was being held captive by Chase with no explanation or expectation of when I would receive my business funds. 

I followed up with numerous phone calls with Chase Business customer support for months consistently. Each time, no representative could give me an answer as to when the rest of my business funds would be available. At times, the representatives said that either the funds were being looked into at the "" back office '' and that there's no way for them to get in contact with the "" back office '' or when they would actually look into this themselves to give me an answer on when my funds would be released. 

On XX/XX/XXXX, I sent XXXX XXXX the following secured message via Virtru : "" Hi XXXX XXXX, Im inquiring about the status of my remaining {$50000.00} in funds in this business checking account that I havent been able to access since XX/XX/XXXX.

I called back on XX/XX/XXXX and again after 2 hours of waiting on hold and transferring internal departments, no clear explanation or expectation of when I will get my funds back. 

I've been beyond patient enough at this point. This entire ordeal, from the lack of business funds that I'm owed to the lack of transparency by JPMorgan Chase, has cause both a financial, mental and emotional distress.

I have multiple credit cards with Bank of America and chose the XXXX XXXXXXXX card because it was best option for my purchase at the time and I believed it to be covered by the cashback offer. On XX/XX/XXXX - after not seeing the cashback I called Bank of America to ask about the cashback. I was told by the customer service rep my problem and he researched and came back to tell me I was not eligible because the card I had chosen was not eligible due to be being a small business card. I told him this was surprising and that I had carefully read the fine print on the offer and the website where the BankAmerideals are marketed and there was no exclusion of the small business cards. Additionally the portal where the cards are shown does not make any distinction between cards. He told me according to the terms of the cardmember agreement BankAmerideals did not apply to small business cards. I asked him to show me the part of the agreement where BankAmerideals and he said he would look for it and put me on an extended hold- when he came back he said he could not find the provision nor could he tell me where to find the card member agreement. My complaint is that there was apparently nothing in the materials for the BankAmerideals portal or fine print that indicated exclusions of cards and that should be where this kind of information is disclosed - otherwise this is deceptive. Additionally in my case I could have easily chosen a different card if I had known the exclusion. I said to the rep this is deceptive and unfair and I would complain to CFPB.

The bank initially acknowledged the claim closed it without proper investigated. I reopened the investigation at my request, and I provided multiple emails and evidence showing this was fraud. 
Despite this, the bank still has not issued a provisional credit, causing further financial and emotional distress. 

I requested escalation within the banks dispute department. 
I reopened the claim, provided compelling evidence, and sought clarity. 
All internal efforts failed, and the bank offered no provisional credit or even a preliminary credit. I am very discouraged because a simple XXXX review will show you XXXX XXXX XXXX  is known for scamming over XXXX customers & has an active lawsuit going on as of now XX/XX/year>!

If you would take a look at the XXXX you will see they have a XXXX I have reached out to XXXX XXXX XXXX  and have been hung up on multiple times, given fake emails contact and once I did get in contact I never get a response back as to why I was charged after our transaction was over and I received my deposit back for my rental which clearly proves there was nothing wrong with the vehicle when it was returned for there to be any extra charges. 
I have acted promptly and provided all necessary support for my legitimate restitution claim. The banks failure to follow mandatory RegE protections is causing financial hardship and shaken trust. I appreciate your attention and guidance on next steps to resolve this matter fully.

Accounts in Dispute : Capital One Account Ending in XXXX Balance : {$510.00} Charged Off : XX/XX/XXXX Date of First Delinquency : XX/XX/XXXX Capital One Account Ending in XXXX Balance : {$440.00} Charged Off : XX/XX/XXXX Date of First Delinquency : XX/XX/XXXX Capital One Account Ending in XXXX Balance : {$3700.00} Charged Off : XX/XX/XXXX Date of First Delinquency : XX/XX/XXXX These accounts are not mine, and I did not open, authorize, or use them. Capital One has admitted they can not provide signed applications or original agreements, which violates FCRA 609 ( a ) ( 1 ) and 611 ( a ) ( 6 ) ( B ) ( iii ). Without this verification, the accounts are unverifiable and must be deleted under FCRA 611 ( a ) ( XXXX ) ( A ). 

Further, the continued reporting of past-due balances after the charge-off dates reflects illegal re-aging and misleads lenders into believing there is current delinquent activity. This directly violates FCRA 605 ( a ) ( 4 ) and Metro 2 guidelines and fails to meet the accuracy standard required by FCRA 607 ( b ).

Capital One also confirmed no IRS Form 1099-C has been issued for these balances, including one exceeding {$3700.00}. This undermines the legal status of the debts and raises concerns about their continued collectibility or validity.

After initial communication, I sent them a standard XXXX  invoice requesting an advance payment. The scammer never paid instead, they used my bank routing and account number from the invoice to fraudulently withdraw {$8000.00} from my business checking account via an unauthorized ACH debit. 

I contacted Bank of America as soon as I discovered the unauthorized transaction, which was the following morning. I had been on a full-day film set and could not monitor my bank account during the shoot. Additionally, I received no alerts or notifications from the Bank of America app about the transaction despite having all notifications turned on. 

When I called the bank, I was told that my fraud report had been properly submitted and that I would receive a response within three business days. I was also told that my account was frozen. However, about five days later, I logged into my online banking and discovered a second fraudulent debit attempt from the same scammers meaning the account had not been secured, despite their assurances. 

Thankfully, the account didnt have enough funds for the second transaction to go through. I immediately contacted the bank again. The representative confirmed the fraud and said they would freeze the second transaction. However, during the call, the rep delayed simple steps for over 30 minutes ( things other reps have handled in 5 ), clearly stalling in hopes I would give up.

At the end of the call, I was told the original {$8000.00} claim had been classified as a dispute and not as fraud, solely because I reported it more than 24 hours after it happened. At no point was I informed this decision had been made, nor was I given any opportunity to confirm or challenge that classification. 

I then visited a physical Bank of America branch, where I opened a new account. The specialist there told me that nothing could be done, claiming the original transaction was a wire transfer not fraud-related. But this was false : I checked my online transaction history and confirmed it was clearly an ACH debit ( labeled D ), not a wire. This appears to be either negligence or intentional misrepresentation by bank staff. 

Multiple representatives gave me false, conflicting, or delayed information. I was reassured, misled, and denied support when I needed protection the most. 

I am not asking for money I am asking for compliance with the law. If a bank claims to protect its clients from unauthorized access, it must act accordingly.

2025-02-04,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Closing your account,Company closed your account,"My name is XXXX XXXX and I would like to file a complaint. I feel that I am being discriminated against. I had 3 capital one cards, 1 credit card for 13 years. Excellent pay history. I had one checking account and 2 savings accounts with capital. One that I have had for approximately 20 years. In XX/XX/XXXX I went to a restaurant to use my card, and It was declined. I picked another Capital One credit card, and It was declined. I logged into Capital One to see what was going on, and it showed that my account was restricted. I contacted Capital One. They informed me that they had closed all 3 of my accounts due to adverse public records. I have XXXX credit, I do not have any adverse public records. 

I am not sure what they are referring to, but the closing of my 3 accounts has damaged my credit. My credit score went from XXXX down to XXXX in a day. As soon as they reported that my accounts had been closed by credit grantor, which implied that I have done something wrong. I have maintained an excellent pay history with Capital One. And I mean, excellent. 

As far as adverse public record, the only thing that I can think of is that in XXXX I was convicted of federal charges. I was sentenced in XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. During that time, I maintained my credit in XXXX status. I was not late, nor did I have delinquent accounts. Everything remained perfect. So there is no reason for my accounts to have been closed for adverse public records. My Credit History is and has been stellar. 

I Have paid capital one perfectly, and they have increased my credit limits repeatedly in the past few years, so my credit history, and my payment history is excellent and was excellent. So, for them to simply close my 3 credit cards because they perhaps discovered that I have a criminal record, is not right. That's not based off of my credit history and ability to pay. Doing this type of discriminatory practice hurts people 's credit, and I worked hard to keep mines good, even when I was struggling. If they are going to use criminal history as criteria for refusing credit then they should disclose that. 

My credit should be based off of just that, my history and ability to pay. Why wouldn't my credit history be based off of my ability to pay. The way that Capital One has closed those accounts, All 3 in 1 day hurt my credit. Went from XXXX to XXXX When I have paid on time? That's not right. 

I worked hard for my credit to be what it was. The only reason that it was not over XXXX like it usually is, is because I had balances. It is usually over XXXX. 


Because they closed those accounts it cut off the credit limits, which made my credit look like I charge over the limit. For example, It went from me having say $ XXXX of available credit down to say $ XXXX but showing that I owe XXXX, which would mean that I have charged over the limit, when I did not. This practice Tanked my score. 


This practice is not right. If criminal history is going to be a factor in their credit process then it should be disclosed up front. Because otherwise I am not being judged off of my ability to pay, and since there are more minorities incarcerated than any other race, this is nothing more than a form of race discrimination.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,GA,30012,,Consent provided,Web,2025-02-04,Closed with explanation,Yes,,11903699,4,3,5,

Despite multiple attempts to enroll in automatic payments for my credit card ( to pay the full statement balance each month ), the system has been unclear and unreliable : On several occasions, the online portal displayed conflicting payment dates for my statement balance in full. For example, one screen showed my payment scheduled for one date, while another section showed the same balance scheduled for a different date.

To avoid duplicate charges, I canceled what appeared to be a duplicate scheduled payment. Instead of leaving one active payment ( which any reasonable consumer would expect ), all payments were canceled without clear notice to me.

As a result, my credit card payment was not made, causing my car insurance payment to fail, interest to accrue, and unnecessary stress.

Additionally, I received no notice to the account being passed due. No email, no call, no text. I was made aware the account was past due due to the insurance payment declined. I then became aware the account was past due on my account homepage.

I also received an email from Bank of America confirming a {$790.00} payment scheduled for XX/XX/XXXX, yet my prior statement balance was not paid as expected. 
Bank of America has sent conflicting emails advising that I have a minimum payment scheduled and confirmed.

I have contacted Bank of America customer service multiple times about these issues. The representatives could not resolve the problem, refused to escalate me to a manager, and instead offered to log a complaint without any meaningful action. One agent even asked me for account information that is already stored in my profile, which is unreasonable and unhelpful.

Bank of America assured me that I was protected under a {$0.00} liability guarantee for unauthorized transactions on my account. Based on this representation, I decided to remain invested with Bank of America, believing my funds were secure. **Incident : ** Recently, my account was compromised due to identity theft, and substantial amounts of money were stolen. Despite promptly reporting the unauthorized transactions to Bank of America, they failed to honor the {$0.00} liability guarantee as promised. Instead, they held me liable for {$4800.00} of the stolen funds, causing significant financial distress and hardship. **Argument : ** **1. False Representation of a Material Fact** Bank of America represented that customers would be protected under a {$0.00} liability guarantee for unauthorized transactions. This representation was a key factor in my decision to remain invested with the bank, believing my funds were secure. **2. Knowledge of Falsity** Bank of America either knew or should have known that their representation of the {$0.00} liability guarantee was false or misleading. The guarantee was not as robust as claimed, resulting in a failure to provide the promised protection. **3. Intent to Induce Reliance** Bank of America intended for me to rely on this misrepresentation. By promoting the {$0.00} liability guarantee, they encouraged customers, including myself, to trust their financial services and maintain accounts with them. **4. Justifiable Reliance** I justifiably relied on Bank of Americas representation of the {$0.00} liability guarantee. As a reasonable person, I trusted the banks assurances and chose to keep my money with them, believing I was protected from unauthorized transactions. **5. Detrimental Reliance** Had I known that the {$0.00} liability guarantee was not as represented, I would have moved my money to a more secure institution. My reliance on Bank of Americas false representation directly resulted in {$4800.00} of financial harm when my account was compromised due to identity theft, and they failed to honor their liability guarantee. **Request for Relief : ** I respectfully request that the CFPB investigate this matter and take appropriate action against Bank of America for their fraudulent practices. I also seek restitution for the {$4800.00} of financial losses incurred due to their failure to honor the {$0.00} liability guarantee.

2024-12-12,Credit card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,"Advertising and marketing, including promotional offers",Didn't receive advertised or promotional terms,"On XX/XX/year>, at approximately XXXX pm, I logged onto my Chase credit card account ( Chase Freedom card ) to view my credit score. On the credit score page, a blue star appeared next to the "" offers '' icon which denotes there are offers available to me. I clicked the icon and there were about 15-20 offers that populated the page. 12 or more of those were offers for credit cards. Not offers "" to apply '' for credit cards. Offers "" to accept '' credit cards that I was already approved for. The offer for each credit card listed on this page read : "" You're approved because of your relationship with Chase. '' Of the dozen or so cards listed, some were Chase XXXX  business cards, some were hotel/airline cards, XXXX were Chase Sapphire XXXX XXXX and XXXX was a Chase Slate Edge card. The Chase Sapphire Reserve, Chase Sapphire XXXX, and Chase Slate XXXX cards all listed the credit limit I was offered. They were as follows : Sapphire Reserved- {$27000.00}, Sapphire XXXX- {$23000.00}, Slate XXXX- {$7000.00}. I reviewed all XXXX cards. The Sapphire cards had an annual fee. The Slate card did not. I read all the terms carefully more than once to make sure I was correctly understanding that I was already fully approved ( not just pre-approved ), and that was indeed what was stated. I was being made an offer to accept at my discretion. If I accepted, I would receive the card chosen, under the terms offered. I was informed I was giving Chase the option to pull my credit report from XXXX ( which didn't make a lot of sense since I was already approved ), but I decided the ding to my credit for the hard inquiry would be offset by the additional available credit added to my accounts. So, I accepted the already approved Chase Slate XXXX card with XXXX annual fee, a {$7000.00} credit limit, and an XXXX promotional 0 % interest on purchases ( and balance transfers with 3 % fee ). I, at no point, agreed to apply for any credit card! I only accepted the offer made to me by clicking the "" ACCEPT '' button. 

As soon as I accepted, instead of getting some kind of acknowledgement like "" Congratulations '', or "" Your new card will arrive shortly, "" I was instead directed to a page which read : "" We need more time to review your Chase Slate Edge request. '' Request? What request? I accepted an offer! We have a deal, period! Where is my card?? 

At that moment my email lit up with multiple notices that my credit had been checked. I noticed my credit score had gone done 3 points because of the inquiry. 

I decided to wait a few days to see if the card was, in fact, on its way, but instead I got a denial letter on XX/XX/year> from Chase that states : "" Thank you for applying for a new CHASE SLATE XXXX  XXXX XXXX account. We reviewed your application, and we're unable to approve this account for you at this time. '' Application? What application? I did not apply for anything!

While renting from XXXX, I was involved in a minor rear-end collision caused by another driver. I promptly reported the incident and returned the damaged vehicle. XXXX issued a replacement vehicle, and I was assured an extension on the rental period to complete final payment without issue. 
Despite this, XXXX repossessed the replacement vehicle without prior notice and charged me a repossession fee-contradicting what I was told. I was also placed on the "" Do Not Rent '' list, which I believe is unfair given the situation and the assurances I received. 
In addition, I was charged more than the agreed amount. I explicitly instructed Bank of America to dispute a {$2800.00} charge from XXXX, explaining that I had been in an accident and was still in the process of finalizing the billing with XXXX. Despite that, Bank of America proceeded to release the funds to XXXX, against my instructions. Since then, I have made repeated requests to the bank to reverse the payment and formally dispute the charge, yet no corrective action has been taken to this point in time. These charges are inaccurate and do not reflect the agreement I had with XXXX. 
I respectfully request : XXXX. To My Bank : Please reopen and fully investigate the disputed charges from XXXX, which were not authorized or agreed to. 
XXXX. To XXXX : Please remove the repossession fee, honor the rental extension, and reconsider my placement on the "" Do Not Rent '' list, as this issue was not my fault. 
Attached to this letter are copies of my email correspondence with XXXX and the police report from the accident. I am appalled that I am being forced to deal with this situation, especially with Bank of America failing to assist me in protecting my own funds. It is unacceptable that I am not being supported in disputing charges that are clearly in question and tied to a situation beyond my control. 
I appreciate your attention to this matter and would welcome a timely resolution. I can provide additional documentation upon request.

However, I never received this letter and still do not know what it contained. This was also confirmed by the first customer service representative I spoke with on XX/XX/year>, after my card was unexpectedly declined at a fueling station. 

I had used the card two weeks prior without issue. The account is not over the credit limit, and payments have always been made on timeoften above the minimum payment. Despite this, the representative was unable to explain why the card was restricted. I asked to speak with a supervisor or someone who could provide further clarification. 

The supervisor claimed that Capital One never sent a letter by mail to my new address. Instead, they stated an email was sent, citing my online communication preferences. This is incorrect, as I continue to receive paper billing statements by mail every monthevidence that Capital One has my correct mailing address and that my preference for paper correspondence is active. 

The supervisor was unable to answer basic yes-or-no questions and, after a difficult conversation, ultimately hung up on me. I found this behavior unprofessional and unhelpful. 

Again, the card is not over the limit, payments are on time and often exceed the minimum, and my credit score is currently in the average range. I have no issues with any other credit card companies. If this issue was related to my address change, why wasnt I properly notified by either email or mail? 

Additionally, I experienced excessively long hold times when trying to resolve this issue. It wasn't until I called the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau ( CFPB ) and arranged a three-way call with Capital One that I was finally able to reach a supervisor. If I had not taken that step, I may never have received a response.

2024-01-02,Credit reporting or other personal consumer reports,Credit reporting,Problem with a company's investigation into an existing problem,Their investigation did not fix an error on your report,"I am filing a formal complaint against Capital One concerning their inadequate investigation process in response to a dispute I initiated on XX/XX/2023, regarding the account number XXXX on my credit report. 

Capital One 's response, dated XX/XX/2023, indicated that they required additional information to proceed with the investigation of my dispute. However, I had already furnished all pertinent details necessary for them to conduct a thorough investigation in my original dispute letter. This delay appears to be an attempt to hinder the investigation process rather than a genuine effort to rectify the inaccuracies. 

Attached to this complaint is a copy of my initial dispute letter to Capital One, as well as their response, for your reference.",,CAPITAL ONE FINANCIAL CORPORATION,VA,20147,,Consent provided,Web,2024-01-02,Closed with explanation,Yes,,8094202,3,4,5,

My credit report shows inaccurate dates of my vehicle reposession. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act I am wanting a removal of account due to inaccurate information. The dispute came back as "" accurate '' ( was not resolved ) and the lender has failed to remove the account even after investigation. 

In addition to the discreptencies, I contacted my XXXX ( XXXX ) and requested a receipt of refund/payout to either myself or the lender due to loss. Unfortunately XXXX XXXX has failed to provide me with the requested information and has no records. My vehicle was a loss and I never received a letter by my GAP insurance of any payment to myself or the lender? 

This unfortunate circumstance has negatively impacted my credit drastically and would appreciate some assistance with this investigation for accurate information. I am attaching a screenshot of the discreptencies from the lender.
